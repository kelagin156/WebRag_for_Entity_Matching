Here is a set of error classes (categories) that explain why the product matching classification system fails on these examples, separated for false negatives and false positives.

---

## False Negatives (FN) Error Classes

These are product pairs that **should be matched** (same real-world product) but the system **fails to predict them as matches**.

### 1. **Variant / Version Differences / Model Variants**
- Products are essentially the same but differ in specific model subvariants, sizes, colors, or configurations.
- Examples: Different model codes/numbers for the same watch or device, or watches differing by size or color but effectively same model line (e.g., Fa5, Fa16, Fa40).
- Difficulty: System underestimates variant similarity or doesn't understand model hierarchy/lineage.

### 2. **Replica vs Authentic Confusion**
- One item is a genuine product, the other is a replica/fake.
- They have very similar titles but system treats them as different classes to avoid false positive matches.
- However, they actually refer to "same" product (with different authenticity).
- Examples: Several Omega and TAG Heuer replica watch pairs (Fa2, Fa26, Fa29, Fa51).

### 3. **Partial / Accessory vs Main Product Confusion / Different Components**
- One entity is an accessory or part related closely to the other product, or two products are complementary but not the exact same item.
- Examples: Battery vs battery charger (Fa12, Fa36), Cable with different connectors (Fa11, Fa35, Fa57), Drone case vs drone+controller (Fa6, Fa31).
- Result: System finds product relation but not direct equivalence.

### 4. **Brand Ambiguity or Related Brands**
- Products from parent/subsidiary brands or slight brand name variations causing system uncertainty.
- E.g., "Ray Ban" vs "Luxottica", or "Fenix" vs "FENIX" charger (Fa4, Fa12, Fa36).
- System struggles connecting products across brand naming nuances.

### 5. **Measurement / Unit / Packaging Differences**
- Differences in units, package sizes or quantities, causing system to fail matching even when product is the same.
- Example: Ammunition box of 250 rounds vs 25 rounds (Fa22, Fa46), battery capacities, or bike tires in inches/metric sizes (Fa10).

### 6. **Insufficient or No Overlapping Description Data**
- One entity has little or no descriptive data apart from title, or manufacturer codes only.
- E.g., short or generic descriptions or missing specs (Fa1, Fa8, Fa28, Fa55).
- Makes system unable to confidently match.

### 7. **Product Family / Line Confusion**
- Products belong to the same family or general type but differ in detailed specs.
- Examples: Different models of gas cooktops or ovens, or different fishfinder models (Fa15, Fa27, Fa44).
- System might consider these separate products despite practical equivalence.

### 8. **Currency / Pricing Differences Affecting Confidence**
- Significant price differences due to currency or region, resulting in low confidence.
- Seen in many pairs with large currency discrepancies, causing system doubt (multiple FNs).

### 9. **Ambiguous or Vague Naming / Spelling Variations**
- Minor misspellings, abbreviations, or alternative formats make system not detect similarity.
- Examples: Fa3 (Shmpo vs Shampoo), Fa7 (back vs backless), Fa32.

### 10. **Product Configuration / Version Mismatch**
- Features or technical details differ sufficiently (like digital vs analog pumps, different specs) so system sees them as distinct products.
- Examples: Fa17 (different pump type), Fa23/Fa47 (floor pumps with different specs).

---

## False Positives (FP) Error Classes

These are product pairs that **should NOT be matched** (different products), but the system **incorrectly predicts them as matches**.

### 1. **Very Similar Model Numbers / Titles but Different Products**
- Products with very similar names, model numbers, or overlapping keywords but are distinct.
- E.g. Peak Design Sling v2 vs Peak Design Sling 10L (some examples like Fa1, Fa88).
- System judges similarity based too heavily on title tokens/brand without deeper semantic difference.

### 2. **Different Variants / Configurations Incorrectly Matched**
- Products have subtle but meaningful differences (size, specs, accessories).
- E.g., Barstools with different colors or back support (Fa7, Fa44, Fa83).
- System misses nuanced specs or visual differences leading to false match.

### 3. **Different Product Types or Subcategories Confused**
- System over-relies on brand and partial overlaps, e.g., battery vs charger treated as same (rare in FP but maybe borderline).
- Occasionally includes different SKUs or accessories as equivalent (less frequent in FP set).

### 4. **Close Alternative / Generational Models Confused**
- Successive model updates or product generations confused as same product.
- Example: Garmin STRIKER 4 and Garmin 010-01872-00 Striker Plus 5Cv (Fa34, Fa68, Fa123).
- System does not distinguish enough between generational upgrades.

### 5. **Brand and Product Line Overlap Ignored**
- Some products from same brand but different official product lines are linked.
- E.g., Asus monitors with very similar specs but distinct models (Fa30, Fa100).
- System treats brand + partial model info as sufficient for match.

### 6. **Poor or Missing Differentiating Attributes / No Deep Attribute Use**
- Products where description is shallow or lacks informative attributes, causing system reliance on titles and brands.
- Leads to false positives when titles are similar but products differ (various examples).

### 7. **Currency or Regional Variation Ignored**
- Products with different pricing or regional model availability are sometimes falsely matched.
- System ignores relevant geographic or model distribution differences.

### 8. **Different Item Quantities / Packaging Confusion**
- e.g., Ammunition products with different quantities but similar product family labeled as same (Fa4, Fa61, Fa92).
- System unable to differentiate packaging size as a critical indicator.

### 9. **Misspelling / Abbreviation Bias Toward Matching**
- Variations in spelling or slight differences cause system to force matching under assumption of typo or variant.

### 10. **High Brand Dominance Leading to Matching**
- System places too much weight on brand match combined with partial model features.
- Results in false positives among products with different models but same brand.

# Explanation

- Many false negatives arise because the system either fails to recognize variant relationships, cannot handle replica vs authentic distinction, or does not understand related but different parts/accessories.
- False positives mostly come from the system over-relying on brand and surface similarity in titles without deep semantic or structural understanding, leading to mistakenly merging distinct but similar products.
- Challenges around currency, regional models, package sizing, and product family membership are common across both error types.

This error taxonomy should help analyze specific failures and guide improvements like better variant detection, replica-aware matching, improved attribute extraction, and more contextual or structured understanding of products.
