Entity 1: Title: 250 Rounds of 1 ounce #8 shot 12ga Ammo by Winchester Price: 72.95 USD Description: If you’re a skeet shooter you understand the importance of high volume shooting. Not only do you go through ammunition on the course working on achieving higher scores but you also go through a great deal during target practice. After all, you’re not going to improve your scores without practice, and that means more trigger time. If you want to be a high volume shooter you should make sure you keep your gun loaded with well-made ammunition, and with Winchester, you can be confident that’s what you’re getting. These Winchester rounds are made for your 12-gauge shotgun. Each round is 2 ¾” long and has a 1 ounce load, which provides substantial power for propelling the buckshot within towards your target with destructive force. Larger loads such as 1 ¼ ounce create significantly more felt recoil, which can make target re-acquisition more difficult. These hulls contain #8 buckshot which is a popular size for shattering clays. Each round leaves the barrel of your shotgun at a muzzle velocity of 1200 feet per second. This ammunition is made by Winchester for target shooting and shattering clays. When you order this box of ammunition from Winchester you get 250 rounds, which is enough to keep you well stocked for some serious target practice with your shotgun. With 250 rounds you can get out on the skeet course or spend time practicing to improve future scores. This ammunition is also great for punching holes in paper. Winchester has been in business since 1866, and all ammunition is made in the U.S. just as it always has been. Place your order today and give your shotgun a substantial meal.

Entity 1: Title: 250 Rounds of 1 ounce #8 shot 12ga Ammo by Winchester Price: 72.95 USD Description: If you’re a skeet shooter you understand the importance of high volume shooting. Not only do you go through ammunition on the course working on achieving higher scores but you also go through a great deal during target practice. After all, you’re not going to improve your scores without practice, and that means more trigger time. If you want to be a high volume shooter you should make sure you keep your gun loaded with well-made ammunition, and with Winchester, you can be confident that’s what you’re getting. These Winchester rounds are made for your 12-gauge shotgun. Each round is 2 ¾” long and has a 1 ounce load, which provides substantial power for propelling the buckshot within towards your target with destructive force. Larger loads such as 1 ¼ ounce create significantly more felt recoil, which can make target re-acquisition more difficult. These hulls contain #8 buckshot which is a popular size for shattering clays. Each round leaves the barrel of your shotgun at a muzzle velocity of 1200 feet per second. This ammunition is made by Winchester for target shooting and shattering clays. When you order this box of ammunition from Winchester you get 250 rounds, which is enough to keep you well stocked for some serious target practice with your shotgun. With 250 rounds you can get out on the skeet course or spend time practicing to improve future scores. This ammunition is also great for punching holes in paper. Winchester has been in business since 1866, and all ammunition is made in the U.S. just as it always has been. Place your order today and give your shotgun a substantial meal.
Entity 2: Title: 12 GAUGE WINCHESTER SUPER TARGET 2-3 4\" #8 SHOT (25 ROUNDS) Price: 10.25 USD Description: This trap and skeet load from Winchester's Super Target series delivers reliable clay-busting performance with every shot. Each shell in this box of 25 fires a one ounce column of #8 shot at a muzzle velocity of 1,180 feet per second, producing nice tight patterns without punishing recoil.Winchester Super Target shells are loaded in Oxford, Mississippi and use high quality powder and hinged wads that provide better accuracy.Place an order for $99 or more and enjoy free shipping from AmmoMan.com!

Entity 1: Title: 250 Rounds of 1 ounce #8 shot 12ga Ammo by Winchester Price: 72.95 USD Description: If you’re a skeet shooter you understand the importance of high volume shooting. Not only do you go through ammunition on the course working on achieving higher scores but you also go through a great deal during target practice. After all, you’re not going to improve your scores without practice, and that means more trigger time. If you want to be a high volume shooter you should make sure you keep your gun loaded with well-made ammunition, and with Winchester, you can be confident that’s what you’re getting. These Winchester rounds are made for your 12-gauge shotgun. Each round is 2 ¾” long and has a 1 ounce load, which provides substantial power for propelling the buckshot within towards your target with destructive force. Larger loads such as 1 ¼ ounce create significantly more felt recoil, which can make target re-acquisition more difficult. These hulls contain #8 buckshot which is a popular size for shattering clays. Each round leaves the barrel of your shotgun at a muzzle velocity of 1200 feet per second. This ammunition is made by Winchester for target shooting and shattering clays. When you order this box of ammunition from Winchester you get 250 rounds, which is enough to keep you well stocked for some serious target practice with your shotgun. With 250 rounds you can get out on the skeet course or spend time practicing to improve future scores. This ammunition is also great for punching holes in paper. Winchester has been in business since 1866, and all ammunition is made in the U.S. just as it always has been. Place your order today and give your shotgun a substantial meal.
Entity 2: Title: 12 GAUGE WINCHESTER SUPER TARGET 2-3 4\" #8 SHOT (25 ROUNDS) Price: 10.25 USD Description: This trap and skeet load from Winchester's Super Target series delivers reliable clay-busting performance with every shot. Each shell in this box of 25 fires a one ounce column of #8 shot at a muzzle velocity of 1,180 feet per second, producing nice tight patterns without punishing recoil.Winchester Super Target shells are loaded in Oxford, Mississippi and use high quality powder and hinged wads that provide better accuracy.Place an order for $99 or more and enjoy free shipping from AmmoMan.com!
