Entity 1: Title: 250 Rounds of 1 ounce #8 shot 12ga Ammo by Winchester Price: 72.95 USD Description: If you’re a skeet shooter you understand the importance of high volume shooting. Not only do you go through ammunition on the course working on achieving higher scores but you also go through a great deal during target practice. After all, you’re not going to improve your scores without practice, and that means more trigger time. If you want to be a high volume shooter you should make sure you keep your gun loaded with well-made ammunition, and with Winchester, you can be confident that’s what you’re getting. These Winchester rounds are made for your 12-gauge shotgun. Each round is 2 ¾” long and has a 1 ounce load, which provides substantial power for propelling the buckshot within towards your target with destructive force. Larger loads such as 1 ¼ ounce create significantly more felt recoil, which can make target re-acquisition more difficult. These hulls contain #8 buckshot which is a popular size for shattering clays. Each round leaves the barrel of your shotgun at a muzzle velocity of 1200 feet per second. This ammunition is made by Winchester for target shooting and shattering clays. When you order this box of ammunition from Winchester you get 250 rounds, which is enough to keep you well stocked for some serious target practice with your shotgun. With 250 rounds you can get out on the skeet course or spend time practicing to improve future scores. This ammunition is also great for punching holes in paper. Winchester has been in business since 1866, and all ammunition is made in the U.S. just as it always has been. Place your order today and give your shotgun a substantial meal.
Entity 2: Title: 12 GAUGE WINCHESTER SUPER TARGET 2-3 4\" #8 SHOT (25 ROUNDS) Price: 10.25 USD Description: This trap and skeet load from Winchester's Super Target series delivers reliable clay-busting performance with every shot. Each shell in this box of 25 fires a one ounce column of #8 shot at a muzzle velocity of 1,180 feet per second, producing nice tight patterns without punishing recoil.Winchester Super Target shells are loaded in Oxford, Mississippi and use high quality powder and hinged wads that provide better accuracy.Place an order for $99 or more and enjoy free shipping from AmmoMan.com!

Entity 1: Title: 250 Rounds of 1 ounce #8 shot 12ga Ammo by Winchester Price: 72.95 USD Description: If you’re a skeet shooter you understand the importance of high volume shooting. Not only do you go through ammunition on the course working on achieving higher scores but you also go through a great deal during target practice. After all, you’re not going to improve your scores without practice, and that means more trigger time. If you want to be a high volume shooter you should make sure you keep your gun loaded with well-made ammunition, and with Winchester, you can be confident that’s what you’re getting. These Winchester rounds are made for your 12-gauge shotgun. Each round is 2 ¾” long and has a 1 ounce load, which provides substantial power for propelling the buckshot within towards your target with destructive force. Larger loads such as 1 ¼ ounce create significantly more felt recoil, which can make target re-acquisition more difficult. These hulls contain #8 buckshot which is a popular size for shattering clays. Each round leaves the barrel of your shotgun at a muzzle velocity of 1200 feet per second. This ammunition is made by Winchester for target shooting and shattering clays. When you order this box of ammunition from Winchester you get 250 rounds, which is enough to keep you well stocked for some serious target practice with your shotgun. With 250 rounds you can get out on the skeet course or spend time practicing to improve future scores. This ammunition is also great for punching holes in paper. Winchester has been in business since 1866, and all ammunition is made in the U.S. just as it always has been. Place your order today and give your shotgun a substantial meal.

Entity 1: Title: 250 Rounds of 1 ounce #8 shot 12ga Ammo by Winchester Price: 72.95 USD Description: If you’re a skeet shooter you understand the importance of high volume shooting. Not only do you go through ammunition on the course working on achieving higher scores but you also go through a great deal during target practice. After all, you’re not going to improve your scores without practice, and that means more trigger time. If you want to be a high volume shooter you should make sure you keep your gun loaded with well-made ammunition, and with Winchester, you can be confident that’s what you’re getting. These Winchester rounds are made for your 12-gauge shotgun. Each round is 2 ¾” long and has a 1 ounce load, which provides substantial power for propelling the buckshot within towards your target with destructive force. Larger loads such as 1 ¼ ounce create significantly more felt recoil, which can make target re-acquisition more difficult. These hulls contain #8 buckshot which is a popular size for shattering clays. Each round leaves the barrel of your shotgun at a muzzle velocity of 1200 feet per second. This ammunition is made by Winchester for target shooting and shattering clays. When you order this box of ammunition from Winchester you get 250 rounds, which is enough to keep you well stocked for some serious target practice with your shotgun. With 250 rounds you can get out on the skeet course or spend time practicing to improve future scores. This ammunition is also great for punching holes in paper. Winchester has been in business since 1866, and all ammunition is made in the U.S. just as it always has been. Place your order today and give your shotgun a substantial meal.

Entity 1: Title: Mavic 2 Enterprise（DUAL) Universal Edition (US & Canada) (SP) Price: 3.35E3 USD Description: DJI Mavic 2 Enterprise DualBuilt upon the Mavic 2 flight platform, the Mavic 2 Enterprise Dual from DJI is an advanced, enterprise-level drone solution for demanding applications. With the addition of a FLIR thermal imaging sensor, the Enterprise Dual can provide even greater capabilities during the night and in challenging daytime conditions. Whether you need an eye in the sky for search and rescue, policing and firefighting support, or for inspections of vital infrastructure, the Mavic 2 Enterprise Dual is designed to be a compact solution that's easily deployable. To help with these tasks, the Mavic 2 Enterprise Dual features a top extended port for mounting helpful modular accessories. You also get 24GB of onboard storage to capture all of the vital data you need when in the field.The Mavic 2 Enterprise Dual features a 24mm camera with a 1 2.3\" 12MP sensor and FLIR thermal imaging sensor. Together they can capture up to UHD 4K resolution video at 30 fps, or thermal imaging images and temperature data. The low-drag aerodynamic body design can achieve speeds of up to 44.7 mph, and the four-cell LiPo battery provides up to 31 minutes of flight time. The Mavic 2 Enterprise Dual also supports the same OcuSync 2.0 video transmission system.OcuSync 2.0 video transmission technology is engineered to provide a stable feed from up to 5 miles away in Full HD 1080p quality, letting you deal with situations in real time without having to be in harm's way. The Mavic 2 Enterprise Dual also features omnidirectional obstacle sensing and avoidance that can be crucial when navigating around sensitive equipment or in rapidly changing emergency scenarios. While navigating the ground, DJI AirSense is included to help avoid hazards in the air. These and a myriad of other features help make for a dependable aerial solution to extend your data gathering capabilities.FLIR Thermal SensorWith the addition of a FLIR thermal sensor side-by-side with the 4K imaging sensor, you can utilize the Enterprise Dual in a variety of scenarios that the Mavic 2 Pro, Zoom, or Enterprise can't handle. The sensor lets you fly by heat signature, allowing for night flying and the avoidance of visual obstacles, such as smoke or fog.Modular Accessory Port with AccessoriesAs if having a fast-moving, 4K-recording, aerial assistant wasn't helpful enough, the Mavic 2 Enterprise expands your ability to help people in need with the inclusion of three modular accessories. These accessories are designed to mount securely to the top of the Mavic 2 Enterprise's extended port. During critical missions in the field, you can use the following: M2E Spotlight: Dual lamps help to spotlight and illuminate the area, helping both people who need to leave an area, and the first responders rushing in to help.M2E Speaker: A loudspeaker that lets you communicate with people on the scene. You can speak in real-time with your voice, or you can use pre-recorded messages in the DJI Pilot app. The loudspeaker can project audio at 100 dB. The 100 dB audio intensity has a range of 3.3'. General communication can vary from 66' to 131', but specific distances will vary based on ambient noise.M2E Beacon: This flashing beacon makes it easier for other pilots and personnel to spot the Mavic 2 Enterprise from a distance during night missions.Password-Controlled DataThe 24GB of built-in storage can possibly contain footage that might range from emergency incidents to critical infrastructure inspections. All of which can be sensitive in nature and should be kept secure from prying eyes and the possibility of being leaked to unauthorized individuals. DJI has recognized the need for data protection and has equipped the Mavic 2 Enterprise with password security in order to gain access to both the drone and the data it holds.Omnidirectional Obstacle SensingTo keep your Mavic 2 Enterprise safe and your footage pristine, DJI has covered all sides of the Mavic 2 with obstacle sensors. The array is comprised of eight high-resolution vision and two infrared sensors, and can detect the following: Forward Sensor: Measurement range of 1.6 to 65.6', and a detectable range of 65.6 to 131.2'. The Mavic 2 is designed to safely stop when obstacles are detected while flying at up to 31.3 mph.Downward Sensor: Measurement range of 1.6 to 36.1' and a detectable range of 36.1 to 72.2'.Left and Right Sensors: Measurement range of 1.6 to 32.8', with a horizontal vertical FOV of 80?ø 65?ø. The Mavic 2 is designed to safely stop when obstacles are detected while flying at up to 17.9 mph.Backward Sensor: Measurement range of 1.6 to 52.5' and a detectable range of 52.5 to 105'. The Mavic 2 has a horizontal vertical FOV of 60?ø 77?ø, and is designed to safely stop when obstacles are detected while flying at up to 27 mph.Upward Sensor: Measurement range of 0.3 to 26.2'.DJI AirSenseWith omnidirectional object avoidance, the Mavic 2 Enterprise is engineered to avoid hazards on all sides within its relative immediate area, but with AirSense, you get instant real-time positioning alerts of nearby manned aircraft as well.GPS TimestampingAll images can be GPS timestamped with the time and date that the images were taken in order to provide industrial applications with accurate data if needed.Self-Heating BatteryThe Mavic 2 Enterprise supports self-heating batteries, which allow you to properly operate the Mavic 2 Enterprise in sub-zero climates.OcuSync 2.0 Video TransmissionThe OcuSync 2.0 system is designed to provide you with a stable, high-quality video feed. DJI has engineered OcuSync 2.0 to deliver 1080p feeds to your controller from up to 5 miles away. From that distance, DJI helps keep things streaming smoothly with dual-band, real-time autoswitching between 2.4 and 5.8 GHz bands. Footage is downloaded at up to 40 Mb s, and latency can be as low as 120 ms.Discreet ModeWhen stealth and uninterrupted flight are essential, use Discreet Mode to shut down all of the LED lights on the Mavic 2 Enterprise.DJI Pilot and FlightHub AppsThe Mavic 2 Enterprise Dual supports both DJI Pilot, which is a robust app that gives you full control over the drone's features, and DJI FlightHub, an app that lets you manage operations for the drone and the rest of your aerial fleet. With the addition of the FLIR thermal imaging sensor, the Enterprise Dual enables the following additional display modes within the DJI Pilot app: FLIR MSX: Combines data from both sensors in real time. This is designed to help enhance visual details and let pilots identify critical information that may have otherwise been invisible to the naked eye.Spot Meter: Shows the average temperature of an object. This is designed to help better locate hard-to-find targets, or stay clear of potentially hazardous substances.Area Measurement: Displays the average, lowest, and highest temperatures in an area and their corresponding locations. This is designed to help inspectors and other professionals on the ground to better assess their surroundings, and then quickly identify problem objects.Isotherm: This allows pilots to search for specific temperature ranges using a custom color palette, and gives you the option of creating custom profiles. The ability has the potential of helping groups, such as firefighters, to find hot spots or locate individuals for rescue.DJI Enterprise Shield Basic Protection Plan for Mavic 2 Enterprise DualEnjoy peace of mind with the Enterprise Shield Basic Protection Plan for Mavic 2 Enterprise Dual from DJI.

Entity 2: Title: Mavic 2 Enterprise（DUAL) Universal Edition (US & Canada) (SP) Price: 3.35E3 USD Description: DJI Mavic 2 Enterprise DualBuilt upon the Mavic 2 flight platform, the Mavic 2 Enterprise Dual from DJI is an advanced, enterprise-level drone solution for demanding applications. With the addition of a FLIR thermal imaging sensor, the Enterprise Dual can provide even greater capabilities during the night and in challenging daytime conditions. Whether you need an eye in the sky for search and rescue, policing and firefighting support, or for inspections of vital infrastructure, the Mavic 2 Enterprise Dual is designed to be a compact solution that's easily deployable. To help with these tasks, the Mavic 2 Enterprise Dual features a top extended port for mounting helpful modular accessories. You also get 24GB of onboard storage to capture all of the vital data you need when in the field.The Mavic 2 Enterprise Dual features a 24mm camera with a 1 2.3\" 12MP sensor and FLIR thermal imaging sensor. Together they can capture up to UHD 4K resolution video at 30 fps, or thermal imaging images and temperature data. The low-drag aerodynamic body design can achieve speeds of up to 44.7 mph, and the four-cell LiPo battery provides up to 31 minutes of flight time. The Mavic 2 Enterprise Dual also supports the same OcuSync 2.0 video transmission system.OcuSync 2.0 video transmission technology is engineered to provide a stable feed from up to 5 miles away in Full HD 1080p quality, letting you deal with situations in real time without having to be in harm's way. The Mavic 2 Enterprise Dual also features omnidirectional obstacle sensing and avoidance that can be crucial when navigating around sensitive equipment or in rapidly changing emergency scenarios. While navigating the ground, DJI AirSense is included to help avoid hazards in the air. These and a myriad of other features help make for a dependable aerial solution to extend your data gathering capabilities.FLIR Thermal SensorWith the addition of a FLIR thermal sensor side-by-side with the 4K imaging sensor, you can utilize the Enterprise Dual in a variety of scenarios that the Mavic 2 Pro, Zoom, or Enterprise can't handle. The sensor lets you fly by heat signature, allowing for night flying and the avoidance of visual obstacles, such as smoke or fog.Modular Accessory Port with AccessoriesAs if having a fast-moving, 4K-recording, aerial assistant wasn't helpful enough, the Mavic 2 Enterprise expands your ability to help people in need with the inclusion of three modular accessories. These accessories are designed to mount securely to the top of the Mavic 2 Enterprise's extended port. During critical missions in the field, you can use the following: M2E Spotlight: Dual lamps help to spotlight and illuminate the area, helping both people who need to leave an area, and the first responders rushing in to help.M2E Speaker: A loudspeaker that lets you communicate with people on the scene. You can speak in real-time with your voice, or you can use pre-recorded messages in the DJI Pilot app. The loudspeaker can project audio at 100 dB. The 100 dB audio intensity has a range of 3.3'. General communication can vary from 66' to 131', but specific distances will vary based on ambient noise.M2E Beacon: This flashing beacon makes it easier for other pilots and personnel to spot the Mavic 2 Enterprise from a distance during night missions.Password-Controlled DataThe 24GB of built-in storage can possibly contain footage that might range from emergency incidents to critical infrastructure inspections. All of which can be sensitive in nature and should be kept secure from prying eyes and the possibility of being leaked to unauthorized individuals. DJI has recognized the need for data protection and has equipped the Mavic 2 Enterprise with password security in order to gain access to both the drone and the data it holds.Omnidirectional Obstacle SensingTo keep your Mavic 2 Enterprise safe and your footage pristine, DJI has covered all sides of the Mavic 2 with obstacle sensors. The array is comprised of eight high-resolution vision and two infrared sensors, and can detect the following: Forward Sensor: Measurement range of 1.6 to 65.6', and a detectable range of 65.6 to 131.2'. The Mavic 2 is designed to safely stop when obstacles are detected while flying at up to 31.3 mph.Downward Sensor: Measurement range of 1.6 to 36.1' and a detectable range of 36.1 to 72.2'.Left and Right Sensors: Measurement range of 1.6 to 32.8', with a horizontal vertical FOV of 80?ø 65?ø. The Mavic 2 is designed to safely stop when obstacles are detected while flying at up to 17.9 mph.Backward Sensor: Measurement range of 1.6 to 52.5' and a detectable range of 52.5 to 105'. The Mavic 2 has a horizontal vertical FOV of 60?ø 77?ø, and is designed to safely stop when obstacles are detected while flying at up to 27 mph.Upward Sensor: Measurement range of 0.3 to 26.2'.DJI AirSenseWith omnidirectional object avoidance, the Mavic 2 Enterprise is engineered to avoid hazards on all sides within its relative immediate area, but with AirSense, you get instant real-time positioning alerts of nearby manned aircraft as well.GPS TimestampingAll images can be GPS timestamped with the time and date that the images were taken in order to provide industrial applications with accurate data if needed.Self-Heating BatteryThe Mavic 2 Enterprise supports self-heating batteries, which allow you to properly operate the Mavic 2 Enterprise in sub-zero climates.OcuSync 2.0 Video TransmissionThe OcuSync 2.0 system is designed to provide you with a stable, high-quality video feed. DJI has engineered OcuSync 2.0 to deliver 1080p feeds to your controller from up to 5 miles away. From that distance, DJI helps keep things streaming smoothly with dual-band, real-time autoswitching between 2.4 and 5.8 GHz bands. Footage is downloaded at up to 40 Mb s, and latency can be as low as 120 ms.Discreet ModeWhen stealth and uninterrupted flight are essential, use Discreet Mode to shut down all of the LED lights on the Mavic 2 Enterprise.DJI Pilot and FlightHub AppsThe Mavic 2 Enterprise Dual supports both DJI Pilot, which is a robust app that gives you full control over the drone's features, and DJI FlightHub, an app that lets you manage operations for the drone and the rest of your aerial fleet. With the addition of the FLIR thermal imaging sensor, the Enterprise Dual enables the following additional display modes within the DJI Pilot app: FLIR MSX: Combines data from both sensors in real time. This is designed to help enhance visual details and let pilots identify critical information that may have otherwise been invisible to the naked eye.Spot Meter: Shows the average temperature of an object. This is designed to help better locate hard-to-find targets, or stay clear of potentially hazardous substances.Area Measurement: Displays the average, lowest, and highest temperatures in an area and their corresponding locations. This is designed to help inspectors and other professionals on the ground to better assess their surroundings, and then quickly identify problem objects.Isotherm: This allows pilots to search for specific temperature ranges using a custom color palette, and gives you the option of creating custom profiles. The ability has the potential of helping groups, such as firefighters, to find hot spots or locate individuals for rescue.DJI Enterprise Shield Basic Protection Plan for Mavic 2 Enterprise DualEnjoy peace of mind with the Enterprise Shield Basic Protection Plan for Mavic 2 Enterprise Dual from DJI. The Mavic 2 Enterprise Dual is not only a considerable investment, but it is likely an integral tool for your business or occupation that you can't be without for extended periods of time.

Entity 1: Title: Mavic 2 Enterprise（DUAL) Universal Edition (US & Canada) (SP) Price: 3.35E3 USD Description: DJI Mavic 2 Enterprise DualBuilt upon the Mavic 2 flight platform, the Mavic 2 Enterprise Dual from DJI is an advanced, enterprise-level drone solution for demanding applications. With the addition of a FLIR thermal imaging sensor, the Enterprise Dual can provide even greater capabilities during the night and in challenging daytime conditions. Whether you need an eye in the sky for search and rescue, policing and firefighting support, or for inspections of vital infrastructure, the Mavic 2 Enterprise Dual is designed to be a compact solution that's easily deployable. To help with these tasks, the Mavic 2 Enterprise Dual features a top extended port for mounting helpful modular accessories. You also get 24GB of onboard storage to capture all of the vital data you need when in the field.The Mavic 2 Enterprise Dual features a 24mm camera with a 1 2.3\" 12MP sensor and FLIR thermal imaging sensor. Together they can capture up to UHD 4K resolution video at 30 fps, or thermal imaging images and temperature data. The low-drag aerodynamic body design can achieve speeds of up to 44.7 mph, and the four-cell LiPo battery provides up to 31 minutes of flight time. The Mavic 2 Enterprise Dual also supports the same OcuSync 2.0 video transmission system.OcuSync 2.0 video transmission technology is engineered to provide a stable feed from up to 5 miles away in Full HD 1080p quality, letting you deal with situations in real time without having to be in harm's way. The Mavic 2 Enterprise Dual also features omnidirectional obstacle sensing and avoidance that can be crucial when navigating around sensitive equipment or in rapidly changing emergency scenarios. While navigating the ground, DJI AirSense is included to help avoid hazards in the air. These and a myriad of other features help make for a dependable aerial solution to extend your data gathering capabilities.FLIR Thermal SensorWith the addition of a FLIR thermal sensor side-by-side with the 4K imaging sensor, you can utilize the Enterprise Dual in a variety of scenarios that the Mavic 2 Pro, Zoom, or Enterprise can't handle. The sensor lets you fly by heat signature, allowing for night flying and the avoidance of visual obstacles, such as smoke or fog.Modular Accessory Port with AccessoriesAs if having a fast-moving, 4K-recording, aerial assistant wasn't helpful enough, the Mavic 2 Enterprise expands your ability to help people in need with the inclusion of three modular accessories. These accessories are designed to mount securely to the top of the Mavic 2 Enterprise's extended port. During critical missions in the field, you can use the following: M2E Spotlight: Dual lamps help to spotlight and illuminate the area, helping both people who need to leave an area, and the first responders rushing in to help.M2E Speaker: A loudspeaker that lets you communicate with people on the scene. You can speak in real-time with your voice, or you can use pre-recorded messages in the DJI Pilot app. The loudspeaker can project audio at 100 dB. The 100 dB audio intensity has a range of 3.3'. General communication can vary from 66' to 131', but specific distances will vary based on ambient noise.M2E Beacon: This flashing beacon makes it easier for other pilots and personnel to spot the Mavic 2 Enterprise from a distance during night missions.Password-Controlled DataThe 24GB of built-in storage can possibly contain footage that might range from emergency incidents to critical infrastructure inspections. All of which can be sensitive in nature and should be kept secure from prying eyes and the possibility of being leaked to unauthorized individuals. DJI has recognized the need for data protection and has equipped the Mavic 2 Enterprise with password security in order to gain access to both the drone and the data it holds.Omnidirectional Obstacle SensingTo keep your Mavic 2 Enterprise safe and your footage pristine, DJI has covered all sides of the Mavic 2 with obstacle sensors. The array is comprised of eight high-resolution vision and two infrared sensors, and can detect the following: Forward Sensor: Measurement range of 1.6 to 65.6', and a detectable range of 65.6 to 131.2'. The Mavic 2 is designed to safely stop when obstacles are detected while flying at up to 31.3 mph.Downward Sensor: Measurement range of 1.6 to 36.1' and a detectable range of 36.1 to 72.2'.Left and Right Sensors: Measurement range of 1.6 to 32.8', with a horizontal vertical FOV of 80?ø 65?ø. The Mavic 2 is designed to safely stop when obstacles are detected while flying at up to 17.9 mph.Backward Sensor: Measurement range of 1.6 to 52.5' and a detectable range of 52.5 to 105'. The Mavic 2 has a horizontal vertical FOV of 60?ø 77?ø, and is designed to safely stop when obstacles are detected while flying at up to 27 mph.Upward Sensor: Measurement range of 0.3 to 26.2'.DJI AirSenseWith omnidirectional object avoidance, the Mavic 2 Enterprise is engineered to avoid hazards on all sides within its relative immediate area, but with AirSense, you get instant real-time positioning alerts of nearby manned aircraft as well.GPS TimestampingAll images can be GPS timestamped with the time and date that the images were taken in order to provide industrial applications with accurate data if needed.Self-Heating BatteryThe Mavic 2 Enterprise supports self-heating batteries, which allow you to properly operate the Mavic 2 Enterprise in sub-zero climates.OcuSync 2.0 Video TransmissionThe OcuSync 2.0 system is designed to provide you with a stable, high-quality video feed. DJI has engineered OcuSync 2.0 to deliver 1080p feeds to your controller from up to 5 miles away. From that distance, DJI helps keep things streaming smoothly with dual-band, real-time autoswitching between 2.4 and 5.8 GHz bands. Footage is downloaded at up to 40 Mb s, and latency can be as low as 120 ms.Discreet ModeWhen stealth and uninterrupted flight are essential, use Discreet Mode to shut down all of the LED lights on the Mavic 2 Enterprise.DJI Pilot and FlightHub AppsThe Mavic 2 Enterprise Dual supports both DJI Pilot, which is a robust app that gives you full control over the drone's features, and DJI FlightHub, an app that lets you manage operations for the drone and the rest of your aerial fleet. With the addition of the FLIR thermal imaging sensor, the Enterprise Dual enables the following additional display modes within the DJI Pilot app: FLIR MSX: Combines data from both sensors in real time. This is designed to help enhance visual details and let pilots identify critical information that may have otherwise been invisible to the naked eye.Spot Meter: Shows the average temperature of an object. This is designed to help better locate hard-to-find targets, or stay clear of potentially hazardous substances.Area Measurement: Displays the average, lowest, and highest temperatures in an area and their corresponding locations. This is designed to help inspectors and other professionals on the ground to better assess their surroundings, and then quickly identify problem objects.Isotherm: This allows pilots to search for specific temperature ranges using a custom color palette, and gives you the option of creating custom profiles. The ability has the potential of helping groups, such as firefighters, to find hot spots or locate individuals for rescue.DJI Enterprise Shield Basic Protection Plan for Mavic 2 Enterprise DualEnjoy peace of mind with the Enterprise Shield Basic Protection Plan for Mavic 2 Enterprise Dual from DJI.

Entity 1: Title: DJI »Mavic 2 Enterprise Universal Edition Dual« drone Price: 2902.95 EUR Description: dji »Mavic 2 Enterprise Universal Edition Dual« drone
Entity 2: Title: Mavic 2 Enterprise（DUAL) Universal Edition (US & Canada) (SP) Price: 3.35E3 USD Description: DJI Mavic 2 Enterprise DualBuilt upon the Mavic 2 flight platform, the Mavic 2 Enterprise Dual from DJI is an advanced, enterprise-level drone solution for demanding applications. With the addition of a FLIR thermal imaging sensor, the Enterprise Dual can provide even greater capabilities during the night and in challenging daytime conditions. Whether you need an eye in the sky for search and rescue, policing and firefighting support, or for inspections of vital infrastructure, the Mavic 2 Enterprise Dual is designed to be a compact solution that's easily deployable. To help with these tasks, the Mavic 2 Enterprise Dual features a top extended port for mounting helpful modular accessories. You also get 24GB of onboard storage to capture all of the vital data you need when in the field.The Mavic 2 Enterprise Dual features a 24mm camera with a 1 2.3\" 12MP sensor and FLIR thermal imaging sensor. Together they can capture up to UHD 4K resolution video at 30 fps, or thermal imaging images and temperature data. The low-drag aerodynamic body design can achieve speeds of up to 44.7 mph, and the four-cell LiPo battery provides up to 31 minutes of flight time. The Mavic 2 Enterprise Dual also supports the same OcuSync 2.0 video transmission system.OcuSync 2.0 video transmission technology is engineered to provide a stable feed from up to 5 miles away in Full HD 1080p quality, letting you deal with situations in real time without having to be in harm's way. The Mavic 2 Enterprise Dual also features omnidirectional obstacle sensing and avoidance that can be crucial when navigating around sensitive equipment or in rapidly changing emergency scenarios. While navigating the ground, DJI AirSense is included to help avoid hazards in the air. These and a myriad of other features help make for a dependable aerial solution to extend your data gathering capabilities.FLIR Thermal SensorWith the addition of a FLIR thermal sensor side-by-side with the 4K imaging sensor, you can utilize the Enterprise Dual in a variety of scenarios that the Mavic 2 Pro, Zoom, or Enterprise can't handle. The sensor lets you fly by heat signature, allowing for night flying and the avoidance of visual obstacles, such as smoke or fog.Modular Accessory Port with AccessoriesAs if having a fast-moving, 4K-recording, aerial assistant wasn't helpful enough, the Mavic 2 Enterprise expands your ability to help people in need with the inclusion of three modular accessories. These accessories are designed to mount securely to the top of the Mavic 2 Enterprise's extended port. During critical missions in the field, you can use the following: M2E Spotlight: Dual lamps help to spotlight and illuminate the area, helping both people who need to leave an area, and the first responders rushing in to help.M2E Speaker: A loudspeaker that lets you communicate with people on the scene. You can speak in real-time with your voice, or you can use pre-recorded messages in the DJI Pilot app. The loudspeaker can project audio at 100 dB. The 100 dB audio intensity has a range of 3.3'. General communication can vary from 66' to 131', but specific distances will vary based on ambient noise.M2E Beacon: This flashing beacon makes it easier for other pilots and personnel to spot the Mavic 2 Enterprise from a distance during night missions.Password-Controlled DataThe 24GB of built-in storage can possibly contain footage that might range from emergency incidents to critical infrastructure inspections. All of which can be sensitive in nature and should be kept secure from prying eyes and the possibility of being leaked to unauthorized individuals. DJI has recognized the need for data protection and has equipped the Mavic 2 Enterprise with password security in order to gain access to both the drone and the data it holds.Omnidirectional Obstacle SensingTo keep your Mavic 2 Enterprise safe and your footage pristine, DJI has covered all sides of the Mavic 2 with obstacle sensors. The array is comprised of eight high-resolution vision and two infrared sensors, and can detect the following: Forward Sensor: Measurement range of 1.6 to 65.6', and a detectable range of 65.6 to 131.2'. The Mavic 2 is designed to safely stop when obstacles are detected while flying at up to 31.3 mph.Downward Sensor: Measurement range of 1.6 to 36.1' and a detectable range of 36.1 to 72.2'.Left and Right Sensors: Measurement range of 1.6 to 32.8', with a horizontal vertical FOV of 80?ø 65?ø. The Mavic 2 is designed to safely stop when obstacles are detected while flying at up to 17.9 mph.Backward Sensor: Measurement range of 1.6 to 52.5' and a detectable range of 52.5 to 105'. The Mavic 2 has a horizontal vertical FOV of 60?ø 77?ø, and is designed to safely stop when obstacles are detected while flying at up to 27 mph.Upward Sensor: Measurement range of 0.3 to 26.2'.DJI AirSenseWith omnidirectional object avoidance, the Mavic 2 Enterprise is engineered to avoid hazards on all sides within its relative immediate area, but with AirSense, you get instant real-time positioning alerts of nearby manned aircraft as well.GPS TimestampingAll images can be GPS timestamped with the time and date that the images were taken in order to provide industrial applications with accurate data if needed.Self-Heating BatteryThe Mavic 2 Enterprise supports self-heating batteries, which allow you to properly operate the Mavic 2 Enterprise in sub-zero climates.OcuSync 2.0 Video TransmissionThe OcuSync 2.0 system is designed to provide you with a stable, high-quality video feed. DJI has engineered OcuSync 2.0 to deliver 1080p feeds to your controller from up to 5 miles away. From that distance, DJI helps keep things streaming smoothly with dual-band, real-time autoswitching between 2.4 and 5.8 GHz bands. Footage is downloaded at up to 40 Mb s, and latency can be as low as 120 ms.Discreet ModeWhen stealth and uninterrupted flight are essential, use Discreet Mode to shut down all of the LED lights on the Mavic 2 Enterprise.DJI Pilot and FlightHub AppsThe Mavic 2 Enterprise Dual supports both DJI Pilot, which is a robust app that gives you full control over the drone's features, and DJI FlightHub, an app that lets you manage operations for the drone and the rest of your aerial fleet. With the addition of the FLIR thermal imaging sensor, the Enterprise Dual enables the following additional display modes within the DJI Pilot app: FLIR MSX: Combines data from both sensors in real time. This is designed to help enhance visual details and let pilots identify critical information that may have otherwise been invisible to the naked eye.Spot Meter: Shows the average temperature of an object. This is designed to help better locate hard-to-find targets, or stay clear of potentially hazardous substances.Area Measurement: Displays the average, lowest, and highest temperatures in an area and their corresponding locations. This is designed to help inspectors and other professionals on the ground to better assess their surroundings, and then quickly identify problem objects.Isotherm: This allows pilots to search for specific temperature ranges using a custom color palette, and gives you the option of creating custom profiles. The ability has the potential of helping groups, such as firefighters, to find hot spots or locate individuals for rescue.DJI Enterprise Shield Basic Protection Plan for Mavic 2 Enterprise DualEnjoy peace of mind with the Enterprise Shield Basic Protection Plan for Mavic 2 Enterprise Dual from DJI. The Mavic 2 Enterprise Dual is not only a considerable investment, but it is likely an integral tool for your business or occupation that you can't be without for extended periods of time.

Entity 1: Title: Mavic 2 Enterprise（DUAL) Universal Edition (US & Canada) (SP) Price: 3.35E3 USD Description: DJI Mavic 2 Enterprise DualBuilt upon the Mavic 2 flight platform, the Mavic 2 Enterprise Dual from DJI is an advanced, enterprise-level drone solution for demanding applications. With the addition of a FLIR thermal imaging sensor, the Enterprise Dual can provide even greater capabilities during the night and in challenging daytime conditions. Whether you need an eye in the sky for search and rescue, policing and firefighting support, or for inspections of vital infrastructure, the Mavic 2 Enterprise Dual is designed to be a compact solution that's easily deployable. To help with these tasks, the Mavic 2 Enterprise Dual features a top extended port for mounting helpful modular accessories. You also get 24GB of onboard storage to capture all of the vital data you need when in the field.The Mavic 2 Enterprise Dual features a 24mm camera with a 1 2.3\" 12MP sensor and FLIR thermal imaging sensor. Together they can capture up to UHD 4K resolution video at 30 fps, or thermal imaging images and temperature data. The low-drag aerodynamic body design can achieve speeds of up to 44.7 mph, and the four-cell LiPo battery provides up to 31 minutes of flight time. The Mavic 2 Enterprise Dual also supports the same OcuSync 2.0 video transmission system.OcuSync 2.0 video transmission technology is engineered to provide a stable feed from up to 5 miles away in Full HD 1080p quality, letting you deal with situations in real time without having to be in harm's way. The Mavic 2 Enterprise Dual also features omnidirectional obstacle sensing and avoidance that can be crucial when navigating around sensitive equipment or in rapidly changing emergency scenarios. While navigating the ground, DJI AirSense is included to help avoid hazards in the air. These and a myriad of other features help make for a dependable aerial solution to extend your data gathering capabilities.FLIR Thermal SensorWith the addition of a FLIR thermal sensor side-by-side with the 4K imaging sensor, you can utilize the Enterprise Dual in a variety of scenarios that the Mavic 2 Pro, Zoom, or Enterprise can't handle. The sensor lets you fly by heat signature, allowing for night flying and the avoidance of visual obstacles, such as smoke or fog.Modular Accessory Port with AccessoriesAs if having a fast-moving, 4K-recording, aerial assistant wasn't helpful enough, the Mavic 2 Enterprise expands your ability to help people in need with the inclusion of three modular accessories. These accessories are designed to mount securely to the top of the Mavic 2 Enterprise's extended port. During critical missions in the field, you can use the following: M2E Spotlight: Dual lamps help to spotlight and illuminate the area, helping both people who need to leave an area, and the first responders rushing in to help.M2E Speaker: A loudspeaker that lets you communicate with people on the scene. You can speak in real-time with your voice, or you can use pre-recorded messages in the DJI Pilot app. The loudspeaker can project audio at 100 dB. The 100 dB audio intensity has a range of 3.3'. General communication can vary from 66' to 131', but specific distances will vary based on ambient noise.M2E Beacon: This flashing beacon makes it easier for other pilots and personnel to spot the Mavic 2 Enterprise from a distance during night missions.Password-Controlled DataThe 24GB of built-in storage can possibly contain footage that might range from emergency incidents to critical infrastructure inspections. All of which can be sensitive in nature and should be kept secure from prying eyes and the possibility of being leaked to unauthorized individuals. DJI has recognized the need for data protection and has equipped the Mavic 2 Enterprise with password security in order to gain access to both the drone and the data it holds.Omnidirectional Obstacle SensingTo keep your Mavic 2 Enterprise safe and your footage pristine, DJI has covered all sides of the Mavic 2 with obstacle sensors. The array is comprised of eight high-resolution vision and two infrared sensors, and can detect the following: Forward Sensor: Measurement range of 1.6 to 65.6', and a detectable range of 65.6 to 131.2'. The Mavic 2 is designed to safely stop when obstacles are detected while flying at up to 31.3 mph.Downward Sensor: Measurement range of 1.6 to 36.1' and a detectable range of 36.1 to 72.2'.Left and Right Sensors: Measurement range of 1.6 to 32.8', with a horizontal vertical FOV of 80?ø 65?ø. The Mavic 2 is designed to safely stop when obstacles are detected while flying at up to 17.9 mph.Backward Sensor: Measurement range of 1.6 to 52.5' and a detectable range of 52.5 to 105'. The Mavic 2 has a horizontal vertical FOV of 60?ø 77?ø, and is designed to safely stop when obstacles are detected while flying at up to 27 mph.Upward Sensor: Measurement range of 0.3 to 26.2'.DJI AirSenseWith omnidirectional object avoidance, the Mavic 2 Enterprise is engineered to avoid hazards on all sides within its relative immediate area, but with AirSense, you get instant real-time positioning alerts of nearby manned aircraft as well.GPS TimestampingAll images can be GPS timestamped with the time and date that the images were taken in order to provide industrial applications with accurate data if needed.Self-Heating BatteryThe Mavic 2 Enterprise supports self-heating batteries, which allow you to properly operate the Mavic 2 Enterprise in sub-zero climates.OcuSync 2.0 Video TransmissionThe OcuSync 2.0 system is designed to provide you with a stable, high-quality video feed. DJI has engineered OcuSync 2.0 to deliver 1080p feeds to your controller from up to 5 miles away. From that distance, DJI helps keep things streaming smoothly with dual-band, real-time autoswitching between 2.4 and 5.8 GHz bands. Footage is downloaded at up to 40 Mb s, and latency can be as low as 120 ms.Discreet ModeWhen stealth and uninterrupted flight are essential, use Discreet Mode to shut down all of the LED lights on the Mavic 2 Enterprise.DJI Pilot and FlightHub AppsThe Mavic 2 Enterprise Dual supports both DJI Pilot, which is a robust app that gives you full control over the drone's features, and DJI FlightHub, an app that lets you manage operations for the drone and the rest of your aerial fleet. With the addition of the FLIR thermal imaging sensor, the Enterprise Dual enables the following additional display modes within the DJI Pilot app: FLIR MSX: Combines data from both sensors in real time. This is designed to help enhance visual details and let pilots identify critical information that may have otherwise been invisible to the naked eye.Spot Meter: Shows the average temperature of an object. This is designed to help better locate hard-to-find targets, or stay clear of potentially hazardous substances.Area Measurement: Displays the average, lowest, and highest temperatures in an area and their corresponding locations. This is designed to help inspectors and other professionals on the ground to better assess their surroundings, and then quickly identify problem objects.Isotherm: This allows pilots to search for specific temperature ranges using a custom color palette, and gives you the option of creating custom profiles. The ability has the potential of helping groups, such as firefighters, to find hot spots or locate individuals for rescue.DJI Enterprise Shield Basic Protection Plan for Mavic 2 Enterprise DualEnjoy peace of mind with the Enterprise Shield Basic Protection Plan for Mavic 2 Enterprise Dual from DJI.

Entity 1: Title: DJI »Mavic 2 Enterprise Universal Edition Dual« drone Price: 2902.95 EUR Description: dji »Mavic 2 Enterprise Universal Edition Dual« drone
Entity 2: Title: Mavic 2 Enterprise（DUAL) Universal Edition (US & Canada) (SP) Price: 3.35E3 USD Description: DJI Mavic 2 Enterprise DualBuilt upon the Mavic 2 flight platform, the Mavic 2 Enterprise Dual from DJI is an advanced, enterprise-level drone solution for demanding applications. With the addition of a FLIR thermal imaging sensor, the Enterprise Dual can provide even greater capabilities during the night and in challenging daytime conditions. Whether you need an eye in the sky for search and rescue, policing and firefighting support, or for inspections of vital infrastructure, the Mavic 2 Enterprise Dual is designed to be a compact solution that's easily deployable. To help with these tasks, the Mavic 2 Enterprise Dual features a top extended port for mounting helpful modular accessories. You also get 24GB of onboard storage to capture all of the vital data you need when in the field.The Mavic 2 Enterprise Dual features a 24mm camera with a 1 2.3\" 12MP sensor and FLIR thermal imaging sensor. Together they can capture up to UHD 4K resolution video at 30 fps, or thermal imaging images and temperature data. The low-drag aerodynamic body design can achieve speeds of up to 44.7 mph, and the four-cell LiPo battery provides up to 31 minutes of flight time. The Mavic 2 Enterprise Dual also supports the same OcuSync 2.0 video transmission system.OcuSync 2.0 video transmission technology is engineered to provide a stable feed from up to 5 miles away in Full HD 1080p quality, letting you deal with situations in real time without having to be in harm's way. The Mavic 2 Enterprise Dual also features omnidirectional obstacle sensing and avoidance that can be crucial when navigating around sensitive equipment or in rapidly changing emergency scenarios. While navigating the ground, DJI AirSense is included to help avoid hazards in the air. These and a myriad of other features help make for a dependable aerial solution to extend your data gathering capabilities.FLIR Thermal SensorWith the addition of a FLIR thermal sensor side-by-side with the 4K imaging sensor, you can utilize the Enterprise Dual in a variety of scenarios that the Mavic 2 Pro, Zoom, or Enterprise can't handle. The sensor lets you fly by heat signature, allowing for night flying and the avoidance of visual obstacles, such as smoke or fog.Modular Accessory Port with AccessoriesAs if having a fast-moving, 4K-recording, aerial assistant wasn't helpful enough, the Mavic 2 Enterprise expands your ability to help people in need with the inclusion of three modular accessories. These accessories are designed to mount securely to the top of the Mavic 2 Enterprise's extended port. During critical missions in the field, you can use the following: M2E Spotlight: Dual lamps help to spotlight and illuminate the area, helping both people who need to leave an area, and the first responders rushing in to help.M2E Speaker: A loudspeaker that lets you communicate with people on the scene. You can speak in real-time with your voice, or you can use pre-recorded messages in the DJI Pilot app. The loudspeaker can project audio at 100 dB. The 100 dB audio intensity has a range of 3.3'. General communication can vary from 66' to 131', but specific distances will vary based on ambient noise.M2E Beacon: This flashing beacon makes it easier for other pilots and personnel to spot the Mavic 2 Enterprise from a distance during night missions.Password-Controlled DataThe 24GB of built-in storage can possibly contain footage that might range from emergency incidents to critical infrastructure inspections. All of which can be sensitive in nature and should be kept secure from prying eyes and the possibility of being leaked to unauthorized individuals. DJI has recognized the need for data protection and has equipped the Mavic 2 Enterprise with password security in order to gain access to both the drone and the data it holds.Omnidirectional Obstacle SensingTo keep your Mavic 2 Enterprise safe and your footage pristine, DJI has covered all sides of the Mavic 2 with obstacle sensors. The array is comprised of eight high-resolution vision and two infrared sensors, and can detect the following: Forward Sensor: Measurement range of 1.6 to 65.6', and a detectable range of 65.6 to 131.2'. The Mavic 2 is designed to safely stop when obstacles are detected while flying at up to 31.3 mph.Downward Sensor: Measurement range of 1.6 to 36.1' and a detectable range of 36.1 to 72.2'.Left and Right Sensors: Measurement range of 1.6 to 32.8', with a horizontal vertical FOV of 80?ø 65?ø. The Mavic 2 is designed to safely stop when obstacles are detected while flying at up to 17.9 mph.Backward Sensor: Measurement range of 1.6 to 52.5' and a detectable range of 52.5 to 105'. The Mavic 2 has a horizontal vertical FOV of 60?ø 77?ø, and is designed to safely stop when obstacles are detected while flying at up to 27 mph.Upward Sensor: Measurement range of 0.3 to 26.2'.DJI AirSenseWith omnidirectional object avoidance, the Mavic 2 Enterprise is engineered to avoid hazards on all sides within its relative immediate area, but with AirSense, you get instant real-time positioning alerts of nearby manned aircraft as well.GPS TimestampingAll images can be GPS timestamped with the time and date that the images were taken in order to provide industrial applications with accurate data if needed.Self-Heating BatteryThe Mavic 2 Enterprise supports self-heating batteries, which allow you to properly operate the Mavic 2 Enterprise in sub-zero climates.OcuSync 2.0 Video TransmissionThe OcuSync 2.0 system is designed to provide you with a stable, high-quality video feed. DJI has engineered OcuSync 2.0 to deliver 1080p feeds to your controller from up to 5 miles away. From that distance, DJI helps keep things streaming smoothly with dual-band, real-time autoswitching between 2.4 and 5.8 GHz bands. Footage is downloaded at up to 40 Mb s, and latency can be as low as 120 ms.Discreet ModeWhen stealth and uninterrupted flight are essential, use Discreet Mode to shut down all of the LED lights on the Mavic 2 Enterprise.DJI Pilot and FlightHub AppsThe Mavic 2 Enterprise Dual supports both DJI Pilot, which is a robust app that gives you full control over the drone's features, and DJI FlightHub, an app that lets you manage operations for the drone and the rest of your aerial fleet. With the addition of the FLIR thermal imaging sensor, the Enterprise Dual enables the following additional display modes within the DJI Pilot app: FLIR MSX: Combines data from both sensors in real time. This is designed to help enhance visual details and let pilots identify critical information that may have otherwise been invisible to the naked eye.Spot Meter: Shows the average temperature of an object. This is designed to help better locate hard-to-find targets, or stay clear of potentially hazardous substances.Area Measurement: Displays the average, lowest, and highest temperatures in an area and their corresponding locations. This is designed to help inspectors and other professionals on the ground to better assess their surroundings, and then quickly identify problem objects.Isotherm: This allows pilots to search for specific temperature ranges using a custom color palette, and gives you the option of creating custom profiles. The ability has the potential of helping groups, such as firefighters, to find hot spots or locate individuals for rescue.DJI Enterprise Shield Basic Protection Plan for Mavic 2 Enterprise DualEnjoy peace of mind with the Enterprise Shield Basic Protection Plan for Mavic 2 Enterprise Dual from DJI.
